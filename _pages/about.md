Hi! I’m Nick Pucci, a Computer Science major with a passion for software, data, and machine learning engineering. I love working in collaborative environments, building solutions that solve complex problems and improve daily life. There's nothing more rewarding than seeing your own work produce real results and make a meaningful impact.

When I first arrived at the University of Alabama, I started as a Computer Engineering major. In January 2023, during my sophomore year, I began my first co-op semester at Adtran. It was an eye-opening experience—I had never been surrounded by so many brilliant and motivated individuals. Being in that environment inspired me and reinforced my belief that, with hard work, there’s no limit to what I can achieve. After one semester, I realized my passion lay more in software than hardware, so I switched my major to Computer Science. Through my time at Adtran, I gained invaluable insight into the tech industry—how modern software teams operate, develop products, and collaborate effectively. More importantly, I learned how to be a strong team player and a continuous learner.

After graduation, I hope to pursue a career in software or data engineering or specialize in machine learning. I also plan to further my education with a Master’s degree in Data Science or Machine Learning after graduation.

Outside of academics and work, I have a wide range of hobbies—I love trying new things and challenging myself. Some of my favorites include playing piano, marathon and triathlon training, and game development. Currently, I’m working on a Unity game, with the goal of publishing it to Steam. Most of the time, I am working on online courses or trying out new side projects to keep my programming skills sharpened.
