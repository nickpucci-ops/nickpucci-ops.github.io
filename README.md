# Website

This is my portfolio website that runs off GitHub Pages. It has some more detailed information about my work and links to linkedin, github, and youtube channels. I generated it using the minimal-mistakes starter template and Jekyll plugins which you can find here: [**template**](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter)
