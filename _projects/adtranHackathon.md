# Development Process
## Idea & Planning
Our team brainstormed ideas and quickly settled on a concept that could be fun yet achievable within the time limit.

## Implementation
The core mechanics were built using **Unity & C#**, with assets created in **jsfxr & Asesprite**. We used GitHub for version control and worked in sprints to stay on track.

## Challenges & Solutions
One of the biggest challenges was implementing smooth physics-based movement. We overcame this by fine-tuning the Rigidbody parameters in Unity and leveraging Unityâ€™s physics engine.
